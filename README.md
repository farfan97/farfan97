<h1>Juan Farfan</h1>
<h3>Public Accountant Specialist in Labor Law and Social Security</h3>

<p>I have worked in various companies in some doing accounting work and in others not, in which I have acquired various skills and competences where I have been able to generate and learn tools that facilitate accounting work.
Currently I work in the Accounting / Payroll area of a logistics and transportation organization located in Colombia, I love Education and Technology, therefore I have decided to mix my profession with the hobbies and skills that I have acquired to teach others what I would have liked to know when it starts. </p>
